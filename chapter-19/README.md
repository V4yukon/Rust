Unsafe Rust: how to opt out of some of Rustâ€™s guarantees and take responsibility for manually upholding those guarantees  
Advanced traits: associated types, default type parameters, fully qualified syntax, supertraits, and the newtype pattern in relation to traits  
Advanced types: more about the newtype pattern, type aliases, the never type, and dynamically sized types  
Advanced functions and closures: function pointers and returning closures  
Macros: ways to define code that defines more code at compile time
