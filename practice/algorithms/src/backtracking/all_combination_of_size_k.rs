/*
 *
 * In this problem, we want to determine all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n . we
 * use backtracking to solve this problem.
 * Time complexity: O(C(n, k)) which is 0(n choose k) = O((n!/(k! * (n-k)!)))
 *
 *
 * generate_all_combinations(n=4, k=2) => [[1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4]]
